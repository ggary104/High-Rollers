# High Rollers Prototype

High Rollers Protoptye is a multiplayer dice-based strategy game built in C++ for play in the console log.
This repository contains a windows and a linux version.
The intention of the prototype is to showcase our initial idea and to help our developers port something they can understand over into gadot.
