**Project Intro**  
High Rollers is a strategic multiplayer dice game that combines luck with tactical decision-making. Players take turns rolling dice and strategically placing them in columns, with the ability to destroy opponents' dice when they achieve two dice in the same column. The game ends when the board is full, but the winner is decided based on whose board has the higher score. The score is determined based on the values of the dice in each player's board, but if a player's column has matching dice, the score of those dice is multiplied by the number of matching dice in the column. This creates strategic depth where players must balance high-value placements with opportunities for scoring multipliers.

**Team Philosophy**

Our team is committed to creating an engaging and well-designed game that demonstrates solid software engineering principles. We aim to balance strategic gameplay with accessible mechanics that players can quickly learn but take time to master.

From a team’s perspective, we want to create a collaborative environment where everyone can contribute their strengths while learning from each other. We want to emphasis on the following key principles:

·  	Regular communication about progress, challenges and solutions.  
·  	Supporting each other through technical difficulties and workload management.  
·  	Respecting different skill levels and learning from each other’s expertise.  
·  	Maintaining focus on both technical excellence and user experience.  
·  	Conducting thorough code and documentation reviews.

**Team roles/responsibilities**

Each team member rated their individual skills (communication (oral/written), presentation, time-management, teamwork, programming, prototyping, design/UI) from 1 (least skilled) to 4 (most skilled). This way allowed us to assess each of our team members’ skill sets and interests, making it easier for us to assign roles and responsibilities.

For each role we have assigned primary leads and understudies:

Primary Role Assignments:

- Seth:  
	*  Development lead (general programming)  
	* Organizational Lead (management)  
 - Gary  
 	* Presentation lead (demos, project presentations)  
	* Version Control lead (git/repo management)  
 - Joseph  
	* Game Design (mechanics, balance, user experience)  
	* Quality assurance (testing)  
 - Harman  
	* Documentation lead (technical docs, user guides)  
 - Abhi  
	* Technical implementation lead (core programming, prototyping)

Understudy Assignments:

·  	Seth: Presentation understudy  
·  	Gary: Documentation understudy, Quality Assurance understudy.  
·  	Joseph: Technical implementation understudy.  
·  	Harman: Organizational understudy  
·  	Abhi: Development understudy, Game design understudy.

Each weekly meeting will begin with 2-3 minutes updates from each member covering current work, upcoming tasks, and workload status to ensure proper task distribution and early problem identification. We expect each team member to share the workload evenly over the course of the semester – though we accept that on a week-by-week basis the workload might be shouldered more by the people most equipped to handle that stage of the project. The overall workload at the end of the semester, however, should be shared equally.

**Planned team meeting time(s) and communication plans**

Our primary communication (synchronous and asynchronous) will be through a discord server set up by our organizational lead, Seth. All team members our expected to respond to each other and check the server at least once per day to not miss any important information. 

The primarily weekly meeting time will be Tuesdays, 2:30 – 3:30 PM. Team are preferred to be present in-person, but discord voice/video chat is always an option if someone is unable to attend.

For each weekly meeting, the organizational lead will post agendas to discord. The documentational lead will take and post meeting notes. Each meeting starts with individual status updates covering recent work, upcoming tasks, and any issues encountered.

If a team member has missed more than two meetings without any prior notification or has not completed assigned work, the entire group is, first, required to meet (in-person or virtually) to discuss the problem and how best to resolve it. If the team has been unable to resolve the issue on their own, then it should be brought to the instructor’s attention.

**Deadline and deliverables**

All team members’ contributions must be completed and shared for peer review with the team 48 hours prior to the deadlines.

For documentation components the organizational lead is the point person to do a final check before submission, for coding components it is the development lead, and for the lab presentations it is the presentation lead. (With all team members assisting with peer review.)

Tuesday meetings serve as primary planning sessions, with additional check-ins scheduled before major deadlines. Consistently missing personal deadlines puts unfair burden on teammates and will be addressed through team discussion first, then instructor involvement if necessary.

**Conflict Resolution:**

Disagreements will be resolved through open discussion emphasizing our team philosophy of constructive collaboration. When consensus cannot be reached, decisions will be made by team vote. In case of ties, the relevant role lead casts the deciding vote. All members agree to abide by this process and support final decisions

**AI Usage Policy:**

·  	Team members are allowed to input project content into AI as long as it doesn’t contain any personally identifiable information (name, contact info, etc.).  
·  	AI can be used as an aid for grammar and editing.  
·  	Team members should ask permission before using AI to generate large/substantial portions of content and must clearly cite that portion.  
·  	All uses of AI in this project must align with the VIU's Student Code of Conduct and the LLM-Use Policy in the course outline.

 

**Team Strengths and Weaknesses:**

The team brings a solid programming foundation with multiple members having strong technical abilities, including Abhi who serves as our lead technical implementer, along with Seth, Joseph, and Gary who all demonstrate capable programming skills. This technical strength is well-balanced by complementary expertise across other critical areas, with Harman contributing valuable documentation and design capabilities, while Gary brings strong presentation skills that will be essential for project demos. Moreover, Joseph and Gary have some experience with Godot (a Game engine) The team's shared enthusiasm for game development and strategic gameplay provides both motivation and a unified vision for creating an engaging final product.

However, the team faces several challenges that will require careful management throughout the project. While some members have limited Godot engine experience, the team will still need to develop deeper expertise with the engine's more advanced features required for multiplayer implementation. The team also lacks extensive experience in multiplayer networking implementation, which is crucial for the game's core functionality, and has limited background in software development team leadership and game testing methodologies.

To address these limitations, the team has developed strategies that leverage individual strengths while supporting areas of weakness. Pair programming sessions will ensure knowledge transfer and provide additional support where needed, while early prototyping will help identify and resolve technical challenges before they become critical roadblocks. Regular code reviews will maintain quality standards and facilitate continuous learning, and the team will strategically utilize each member's expertise in their strongest areas to maximize overall project effectiveness and ensure successful delivery.

The team is optimistic about delivering a compelling dice game that demonstrates both technical competence and engaging gameplay mechanics.
