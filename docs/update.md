## Progress in Phase 2

During Phase 2, we began by presenting our project plan to the class. Our main goals for this phase were to set up version control, complete our standards documentation, and begin our requirements document.

Our Version Control Lead successfully set up the GitHub repository and invited our instructor. The Documentation Lead completed the standards document and started preparing the updates document to reflect our ongoing progress. As planned, we will revisit our Team Charter and Proposal to incorporate the feedback provided by Dave before finalizing the requirements document.

Because some team members were new to the Godot engine, we dedicated the first week of Phase 2 to learning it. Our Technical Implementation Lead successfully ported our existing C++ prototype into GDScript within Godot. A “Game Over” screen was also added to the prototype.

Meanwhile, our Design Lead began developing ideas for the game’s design and mechanics, which will become the main focus in Phase 3. Our Development Lead started researching multiplayer functionality since this is a new area for most of our team.

Overall, we met our goals for Phase 2 as planned.

## Changes in risk assessment

We plan to update our Team Charter and Proposal to include a contingency plan for the event that a team member drops out. As a five-person team, losing one member would require redistributing tasks based on each person’s designated understudy role to ensure continued progress.


## Changes in product features

We are continuing to refine our game’s concept. After receiving feedback from Dave, we discussed incorporating small tournaments into the gameplay. We are also considering adding power-ups and increasing difficulty levels as players earn more coins by winning games. These ideas will be explored further in Phase 3.

## Current state of each deliverable 

Our Team Charter and Proposal currently require only minor revisions based on the feedback we received from Phase 1. Once these updates are made, we will move on to developing our requirements document. The standards document has been completed, and our updates document is being maintained regularly to record our team’s progress.

Our GitHub repository has been set up and is fully functional, allowing all team members to collaborate effectively. The Technical Implementation Lead has successfully ported our existing C++ prototype to Godot. In terms of design and art assets, our Design Lead has begun developing initial ideas for the visual and gameplay aspects of the project. These elements will become our primary focus in the next phase, where we plan to refine the game’s overall design and expand on its artistic direction.
