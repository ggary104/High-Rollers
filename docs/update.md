## Progress in Phase 2

During Phase 2, we began by presenting our project plan to the class. Our main goals for this phase were to set up version control, complete our standards documentation, and begin our requirements document.

Our Version Control Lead successfully set up the GitHub repository and invited our instructor. The Documentation Lead completed the standards document and started preparing the updates document to reflect our ongoing progress. As planned, we will revisit our Team Charter and Proposal to incorporate the feedback provided by Dave before finalizing the requirements document.

Because some team members were new to the Godot engine, we dedicated the first week of Phase 2 to learning it. Our Technical Implementation Lead successfully ported our existing C++ prototype into GDScript within Godot. A “Game Over” screen was also added to the prototype.

Meanwhile, our Design Lead began developing ideas for the game’s design and mechanics, which will become the main focus in Phase 3. Our Development Lead started researching multiplayer functionality since this is a new area for most of our team.

Overall, we met our goals for Phase 2 as planned.

## Changes in risk assessment

We plan to update our Team Charter and Proposal to include a contingency plan for the event that a team member drops out. As a five-person team, losing one member would require redistributing tasks based on each person’s designated understudy role to ensure continued progress.


## Changes in product features

We are continuing to refine our game’s concept. After receiving feedback from Dave, we discussed incorporating small tournaments into the gameplay. We are also considering adding power-ups and increasing difficulty levels as players earn more coins by winning games. These ideas will be explored further in Phase 3.

## Current state of each deliverable 

Our Team Charter and Proposal currently require only minor revisions based on the feedback we received from Phase 1. Once these updates are made, we will move on to developing our requirements document. The standards document has been completed, and our updates document is being maintained regularly to record our team’s progress.

Our GitHub repository has been set up and is fully functional, allowing all team members to collaborate effectively. The Technical Implementation Lead has successfully ported our existing C++ prototype to Godot. In terms of design and art assets, our Design Lead has begun developing initial ideas for the visual and gameplay aspects of the project. These elements will become our primary focus in the next phase, where we plan to refine the game’s overall design and expand on its artistic direction.





##Progress in Phase 3

During Phase 3, our team focused on consolidating all project documentation and refining the core components of the game prototype. The main objectives for this phase were to finalize the Team Charter, Proposal, and Requirements and Specifications documents, as well as to polish and stabilize the Godot prototype in preparation for the next development phase.

On the technical side, significant progress was made within the Godot project. The team completed the integration of dice assets, implemented an attacking and health system, developed a main menu, and introduced a classic mode for testing basic gameplay functionality. Additional rework was done to improve overall structure and gameplay flow, ensuring the prototype was ready for further expansion. All conflicts within the project files were resolved to maintain a clean and functional repository.

In terms of documentation, Requirements and Specifications document and progress update document were completed as scheduled, and the repository remains well-organized under clearly defined directories for documentation, game code, prototypes, and presentations.

Overall, Phase 3 went according to plan, with both documentation and technical milestones achieved on time, setting a solid foundation for the development and testing phases ahead.

##Changes in Risk Assessment

Our risk profile remains stable compared to previous phases. The addition of a member dropout contingency plan in the Team Charter continues to mitigate the main personnel risk. With the prototype’s structure solidified, upcoming risks are primarily technical — particularly regarding multiplayer implementation and timely integration of new game mechanics. These will be managed through shorter iteration cycles, frequent testing, and weekly review meetings to monitor progress and prevent major setbacks.

##Changes in Product Features

The core gameplay direction remains unchanged, but some refinements were made to focus on producing a polished and playable MVP. The team decided to prioritize single-player functionality to ensure all core mechanics, such as dice interactions, health systems, and game flow, are fully functional before expanding to multiplayer. Additional gameplay ideas like tournaments and power-ups have been reclassified as post-MVP features for later development.

##Current State of Each Deliverable

All deliverables are in strong standing at the end of Phase 3. The Team Charter, Proposal, and Requirements and Specifications have been completed. The Standards document remains complete and consistent with team practices. The Design Document and Art Assets are being actively developed but will be refined in phase 4, focusing on the visual direction and game layout. The Test Plan will be created during Phase 4 once the initial gameplay prototype is ready for functional testing.

The Godot prototype is stable, featuring a functional main menu, classic mode, attack and health systems, and integrated dice mechanics. Early reworks have enhanced both structure and playability. The repository remains organized, with all conflicts resolved and the latest updates successfully pushed for team access.
