##Progress in phase 2
Our plan for phase 2 was to have our team's version control lead have a github repository set up. For the documentation part we had planned to have our Documentation lead complete our standards document completed first and then to start working on the our requirements document. As some of us were lacking expeirience in Godot we took a week to go learn Gogot engine. Then our plan was to get our already exisiting C++ protoype into GDscript in Godot which was decided to be handled by our 
Our team's version control lead set up our git repository and invited our instructor.

Much like the team presentations at the end of this phase, the document is meant to give a clear summary of the progress made in the current phase and the current state of all project deliverables.

The document should highlight:
- The progress made in the current phase, and how that compared to the team's original plan for the phase,
- any changes to the assessed risks for the project,
- any changes to the planned product features or functionality, or long term goals for the project,
- the current state of each deliverable (charter, standards, requirements, design, test plan, repo/infrastructure, code base, art assets, etc).
