------------------DELETE THESE NOTES--------------------
Much like the team presentations at the end of this phase, the document is meant to give a clear summary of the progress made in the current phase and the current state of all project deliverables.

The document should highlight:
- The progress made in the current phase, and how that compared to the team's original plan for the phase,
- any changes to the assessed risks for the project,
- any changes to the planned product features or functionality, or long term goals for the project,
- the current state of each deliverable (charter, standards, requirements, design, test plan, repo/infrastructure, code base, art assets, etc).
