## Progress in Phase 2

We had a deliverable a in which we layed out our plan during a team presentation in the first week of our Phase 2. Our plan for phase 2 was to have our team's version control lead have a github repository set up. For the documentation part we had planned to have our Documentation lead complete our standards document completed first and then to start working on the our requirements document. As some of us were lacking expeirience in Godot we took a week to go learn Gogot engine. Then our plan was to get our already exisiting C++ protoype into GDscript in Godot which was decided to be handled by our Technical implementation lead. Our Design lead was assigned to get started on ideas with our game design ideas which will be our main focus for the Phase 3. Our Developmental lead was assigned to start researching multiplayer since we have little experience in that aspect. 

Our team's version control lead set up our git repository and invited our instructor. Our Technical Implementation Lead was successful in porting our existing C++ protoype to GDscript in Godot engine. We completed our standards document and updates document according to our progress. As for our requirements document, we will first review our Team Charter and Proposal and work on the minor fixes that are required and then pick up our requirements document after those changes have been made as provided in the feedback by Dave. Our design lead has made quite a bit of progress which we be discussed in more detail in our next meetings and next phase. 

## Changes in risk assessment
We need to include in our Charter and Proposal- how we would handle the situation if someone drops out.


## Changes in product features
We might keep making certain chnages to our game plan. We really liked Dave's idea about having small tournaments. We discussed about addis

## Current state of each deliverable 
We decided our charter and proposal need minor changes after we got feedback on Phase 1 documentation from Dave. 

------------------DELETE THESE NOTES--------------------
Much like the team presentations at the end of this phase, the document is meant to give a clear summary of the progress made in the current phase and the current state of all project deliverables.

The document should highlight:
- The progress made in the current phase, and how that compared to the team's original plan for the phase,
- any changes to the assessed risks for the project,
- any changes to the planned product features or functionality, or long term goals for the project,
- the current state of each deliverable (charter, standards, requirements, design, test plan, repo/infrastructure, code base, art assets, etc).
