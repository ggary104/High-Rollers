* You and your opponent start with a set amount of health
* At the start of your turn, you get a random die from 1-6
* You have 3 options on your turn: PLACE, BREAK, or SKIP
* PLACE lets you place your die anywhere on the 3x3 board
* Placing a die adds to your score by the amount on the dice
* SKIP skips your turn, to hopefully get a better die next turn
* BREAK lets you cash in your score and deal damage to the opponent
* It also clears your board
* The game ends when a player’s health reaches 0


Dice Effects:

* ONE: When cashed in, adds 1 to your health
* TWO: If two of them are placed in the same row, double the score for that row
* THREE: When placed, gives you 1 reroll. A player can only have 1 reroll at any time.
* FOUR: Can be placed in an empty spot on your board to destroy your opponent’s corresponding die. Can also be placed on a die to destroy both the die and it
* FIVE: Adds 5 to your score. Good resource for points
* SIX: Adds 6 to your score for every point above 3 the average dice value is e.g. If the average value of all the dice on the board is 1-3.9, give no points. If the average is 5, give 12 points.
