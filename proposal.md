# CSCI 265 Initial Project Proposal

## Team name: YOUR TEAM NAME HERE

## Project/product name: YOUR PRODUCT NAME HERE

## Contact person and email address

Provide the full name and email address for the key contact person for this document (in case the reader has questions).

## Project Overview

Provide two or three paragraphs outlining the product in general. (What would you tell a potential user if you were trying to get them interested in the product?)

## Target audience and motivation

Provide a paragraph or two describing the target audience for the product and why they will be interested in it, and a paragraph or two describing your own team's interest/motivation for making this particular product.

## Key features and discussion

Provide a list of the key features of the product and a deeper discussion of the product in relation to those.  By the time the reader finishes this section they should have a strong idea of what your proposed product is all about.

## Preliminary interface sketches

Provide a first rough draft of an interface (screens, menus, etc) to have a shared preliminary vision of the product look and feel.  Be sure to include some accompanying explanation to put the various sketches in perspective (never leave the reader wondering how the parts fit together).

## Scaling plans

Provide a short discussion of how the project can be scaled up/down in the future if it begins to look too large to complete on time or too small to provide a suitable challenge for the team.

## Risks and potential issues

Provide a list of anticipated problems/risks associated with the product design and development and the team's plans for how to deal with them.  (Organizational/team risks will be covered in the team charter.)
